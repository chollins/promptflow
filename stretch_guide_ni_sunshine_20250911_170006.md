---

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Setup:**
   - Find a comfortable, flat surface where you can lie down. Use a yoga mat or soft carpet for added comfort.

2. **Starting Position:**
   - Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart. Your arms should be relaxed at your sides.

3. **Arm Positioning:**
   - Slowly raise your arms out to the sides, keeping them parallel to the ground. Your arms should form a "T" shape, with the palms facing up. Ensure that your shoulders are relaxed and pressed down towards the floor.

4. **Adjust the Angle:**
   - If you're comfortable, you can gently slide your arms back towards the floor, aiming to stretch the chest muscles. This might mean keeping your elbows slightly bent if necessary to avoid strain.

5. **Breath Deeply:**
   - Take a deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs fully, and feel your chest expand. Hold this position for 15-30 seconds while continuing to breathe deeply.

6. **Relax:**
   - As you exhale through your mouth, allow your arms to relax back towards the ground, feeling the stretch deepen in your chest. 

7. **Repeat:**
   - If comfortable, repeat the stretch 2-3 times, holding for 15-30 seconds each time. 

8. **Finished Position:**
   - To finish, gently bring your arms back to your sides, roll over onto one side, and then slowly push yourself up to a seated or standing position.

#### Benefits:

- **Increases Flexibility:** The supine chest stretch helps improve flexibility in the chest and shoulders, promoting a greater range of motion.
  
- **Chest Expansion:** Stretching the pectoralis major can help open up the chest area, counteracting the effects of sitting and hunching over, which tightens these muscles.

- **Improves Posture:** Regular practice can aid in correcting posture by encouraging muscles that may be tight to release, leading to improved alignment of the spine.

- **Enhances Circulation:** The stretch encourages better blood flow in the chest area, which can contribute to muscle recovery and overall chest health.

- **Reduces Tension:** This stretch is particularly beneficial for relieving tension built up in the chest and shoulder areas, often caused by stress or prolonged periods of sitting.

#### Precautions:

- **Consult a Professional:** If you have any pre-existing shoulder or back injuries, consult a healthcare provider or physical therapist before attempting this stretch.

- **Listen to Your Body:** Only stretch to the point of mild discomfort, not pain. If you feel pain during the stretch, ease off and adjust your arm positioning or consult with a professional.

- **Avoid Arching Your Back:** Make sure your back remains flat against the ground. If your lower back starts to arch, modify your arm position to find a more comfortable stretch.

- **Warm Up First:** Engage in a warm-up of light activity or dynamic stretches to prepare your muscles for deeper stretches.

- **Stay Engaged:** Avoid 'locking' your shoulders. Keep them relaxed and engaged during the stretch to prevent strain.
