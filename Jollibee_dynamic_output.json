    "image_prompts": "1. \"Savor the Happiness in Every Bite\"\nCreate an image of a young woman sitting at a rustic wooden table, enjoying a slice of homemade apple pie. The style should be warm and inviting, with a soft, natural light illuminating the scene. The woman should be in mid-bite, her eyes closed in delight, and a small smile on her face. The pie should be in focus, with steam gently rising from it, indicating its freshness. The composition should be such that the viewer's eye is drawn to the pie and the woman's expression of enjoyment. The image should be a realistic illustration, with attention to detail in the textures of the pie crust and the woman's clothing.\n\n2. \"Taste the World from Your Plate\"\nDesign an image of a vibrant, colorful plate filled with a variety of foods from around the world. The style should be bright and lively, with a high contrast lighting to emphasize the different colors and textures of the food. The composition should be a top-down view of the plate, with each food item arranged in a visually pleasing manner. The plate should be placed on a world map tablecloth, subtly indicating the global nature of the food. The image should be a high-resolution photograph, with a shallow depth of field to focus on the food and blur the background slightly.\n\n3. \"Earn Rewards, Enjoy the Feast\"\nCraft an image of a grand banquet table laden with a feast of delicious foods, with a golden trophy placed prominently in the center. The style should be opulent and luxurious, with dramatic, warm lighting to highlight the richness of the food and the shine of the trophy. The composition should be a wide-angle shot, capturing the length of the table and the variety of dishes. The image should be a detailed illustration, with particular attention paid to the textures and colors of the food and the intricate details of the trophy."
