## Stretch: Doorway Stretch

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Find a Doorway**:
   - Locate a doorway or any vertical surface where you can easily place your arms.

2. **Position Yourself**:
   - Stand in the doorway facing it, ensuring you have enough space to stretch your arms.

3. **Set Your Arms**:
   - Raise your arms to shoulder height and bend your elbows at 90 degrees. Your forearms should be either parallel to the ground or slightly upward.
   - Place your forearms against the door frame, with your hands facing up or sideways.

4. **Step Forward**:
   - Slowly lean your body forward through the doorway. You should feel a gentle stretch in the front of your shoulders and upper arms (deltoids).
   - Keep your back straight and avoid arching.

5. **Hold the Stretch**:
   - Maintain this position for 15–30 seconds, breathing deeply and relaxing into the stretch. Focus on not tensing your shoulders.

6. **Release**:
   - Gradually step back out of the doorway to release the stretch. Lower your arms and let them relax at your sides.

7. **Repeat**:
   - You can perform this stretch 2–3 times, resting for a few seconds between each repetition.

### Benefits:

- **Improves Flexibility**: The doorway stretch helps to enhance the flexibility of the deltoid muscles, making them more pliable and less prone to injury.
- **Relieves Tension**: Stretching the deltoids can minimize muscle tightness from activities like lifting, reaching, or working at a desk.
- **Enhances Range of Motion**: It can improve your overall shoulder mobility, benefiting daily activities and athletic performance.
- **Posture Improvement**: The stretch encourages proper shoulder alignment, which is crucial for maintaining good posture and reducing back strain.

### Precautions:

- **Warm Up First**: Ensure you perform a light warm-up before stretching, such as jogging in place or doing arm circles to increase blood flow to the muscles.
- **Avoid Overstretching**: Only lean forward until you feel a gentle stretch; do not push to the point of pain. Overstretching can lead to injury.
- **Listen to Your Body**: If you feel any sharp pain or discomfort during the stretch, stop immediately. It's essential to distinguish between a gentle stretch and actual discomfort.
- **Consult a Professional**: If you have any existing shoulder injuries or conditions, consult with a healthcare or fitness professional before attempting the doorway stretch.

### Conclusion

The Doorway Stretch is a simple yet effective way to enhance the flexibility and comfort of your deltoid muscles. Incorporate it into your regular stretching routine to maintain healthy arms and shoulders!
