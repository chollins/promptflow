### Practical Tips:
- **Transportation:** Since you're renting a car, ensure you have a navigation app that's reliable for Japan. Parking is available in most areas, but always check for local parking regulations.
  
- **Language:** A translation app can be handy as not all locals will speak English fluently. Basic phrases in Japanese can also enhance your experience.

- **Cash:** While credit cards are accepted in many places, smaller shops and restaurants may prefer cash. Have some yen ready.

- **Weather:** September can be warm and humid. Dress in light and breathable clothing, and always stay hydrated.

- **Cultural Respect:** When visiting temples and shrines, be respectful in dress and behavior. Always remove shoes where required and be quiet in sacred spaces.
