## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Starting Position**:  
   Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart. Ensure your posture is straight, with shoulders relaxed and down.

2. **Raise One Arm**:  
   Lift one arm overhead so that your elbow is bent, and your hand reaches down your upper back. Aim to touch the middle of your back with your hand.

3. **Position Your Other Arm**:  
   With your opposite hand, gently grasp the elbow of the raised arm. Your other hand should be positioned behind your head.

4. **Gently Pull**:  
   Using your opposite hand, gently pull your bent elbow back for a deeper stretch. Ensure that you're not pulling too hard; you should feel a comfortable stretch along your triceps and the back of your arm.

5. **Hold the Position**:  
   Maintain this position for 15 to 30 seconds. Breathe deeply and relax your shoulders during the stretch.

6. **Release and Repeat**:  
   Slowly release your arm back to the starting position. Switch arms and perform the stretch on the other side.

7. **Repetition**:  
   Repeat the stretch 2-3 times on each side, ensuring you maintain controlled movements and proper posture throughout.

- **Reduces Muscle Tension**: Regular stretching can help alleviate tightness in the arms and shoulders, which can be beneficial after workouts or prolonged periods of inactivity.
- **Improves Range of Motion**: Enhances the overall range of motion in the shoulder joint, which can positively impact activities requiring arm movement.

## Precautions

- **Warm Up First**: Always warm up your body with light aerobic activity (e.g., brisk walking, arm circles) for 5-10 minutes before stretching to prevent injury.
- **Listen to Your Body**: If you experience sharp or intense pain during the stretch, stop immediately. Stretching should never be painful.
- **Avoid Overstretching**: Do not pull excessively on your elbow; a gentle stretch is sufficient. You should feel a mild tension, not pain.
- **Protect Your Neck**: Keep your head and neck in a neutral position throughout the stretch to avoid strain.
- **Use a Wall or Chair for Support**: If you find it challenging to maintain balance, you can lean against a wall or hold onto a chair for support during the stretch.
