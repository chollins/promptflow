## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Find a Wall
Locate a flat wall where you can stand comfortably without any obstructions. Ensure the surface is smooth to avoid any injuries.

### Step 2: Position Your Body
1. **Stand Facing Away from the Wall**: Stand slightly away from the wall with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2. **Extend One Arm**: Reach your right arm behind you and out to the side, keeping it straight at shoulder height.

### Step 3: Place Your Hand on the Wall
1. **Palm Against the Wall**: Press your right palm firmly against the wall.
2. **Align Fingers**: Ensure your fingers point straight up toward the ceiling with your arm fully extended.

### Step 4: Rotate Your Shoulder
1. **Gently Rotate Your Body**: Keeping your palm pressed against the wall, turn your torso away from your arm. 
2. **Feel the Stretch**: You should start to feel a stretch in your biceps, shoulder, and chest. 

### Step 5: Hold the Position
1. **Hold the Stretch**: Maintain this position for 15-30 seconds, breathing deeply and relaxing into the stretch. 
2. **Switch Sides**: Slowly release your arm and rotate back to face the wall. Repeat the stretch with your left arm.

### Step 6: Repeat
1. **Perform Multiple Sets**: Aim to complete 2-3 sets on each side for optimal results.

## Precautions

- **Warm-Up First**: Always do a light warm-up before stretching to avoid injuries. Engage in light aerobic activity for 5-10 minutes.
- **Listen to Your Body**: If you feel pain (not just discomfort) during the stretch, stop immediately.
- **Avoid Overextending**: Do not force your arm to rotate too far; this could strain your shoulder or biceps.
- **Consult a Professional**: If you have pre-existing shoulder or biceps injuries, consult with a healthcare provider or physical therapist before attempting this stretch.
- **Maintain Proper Form**: Ensure that your body is aligned and not twisting in an unnatural way during the stretch.
