#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Starting Position:** 
   - Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart. You can also perform this stretch while seated if it is more comfortable.

2. **Raise Your Arm:**
   - Extend your right arm straight up towards the ceiling. Ensure your elbow is close to your ear.

3. **Bend the Elbow:**
   - Gently bend your right elbow and allow your forearm to drop behind your head. Your hand should move down your back, ideally reaching toward your upper back or between the shoulder blades.

4. **Grip for Support (Optional):**
   - If you can, use your left hand to grab your right elbow to gently assist in the stretch. This adds leverage and helps deepen the stretch in the triceps.

5. **Emphasis on Positioning:**
   - Keep your torso upright and avoid arching your back. Your head should remain neutral, looking forward.

6. **Hold the Stretch:**
   - Hold the position for 15-30 seconds. Focus on breathing deeply and evenly during this time.

7. **Release & Repeat:**
   - Slowly release your arm back to the starting position. Repeat the stretch on the left side using the same steps.

8. **Repetition:**
   - Perform the stretch 2-3 times on each arm to ensure even stretching.

#### Precautions:

- **Avoid Overstretching:** Ensure you stretch to the point of mild discomfort, not pain. Overstretching can lead to strains.
- **Injury Considerations:** If you have a recent injury or strain in your shoulder, elbow, or triceps, consult a medical professional before performing this stretch.
- **Balanced Stretching:** Always stretch both arms to maintain muscular balance and prevent imbalances that can lead to injury.
- **Posture Awareness:** Monitor your posture during the stretch to avoid straining your lower back. Keep your core engaged and avoid leaning forward or backward excessively.
- **Breathing:** Do not hold your breath; remember to breathe deeply and evenly to enhance relaxation and effectiveness during the stretch.
