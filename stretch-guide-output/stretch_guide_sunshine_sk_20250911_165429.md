---

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Find a Comfortable Seated Position:**
   - Sit on a sturdy chair or on the floor in a cross-legged position. Ensure your back is straight, and your shoulders are relaxed.

2. **Prepare Your Arm:**
   - Reach your right arm across your body at shoulder height. Keep it straight while ensuring your shoulder is relaxed and not hunched.

3. **Hold Your Arm:**
   - Use your left hand to gently grasp your right arm just above the elbow or, if more comfortable, at the wrist. 

4. **Pull Gently:**
   - While keeping your shoulders down and relaxed, gently pull your right arm across your body towards the left side. You should feel a mild stretch in your deltoid and the shoulder area.

5. **Hold the Stretch:**
   - Maintain this position for 15 to 30 seconds. Focus on your breathing; inhale deeply and exhale slowly to enhance relaxation.

6. **Release the Stretch:**
   - Gently release your right arm and allow it to return to the starting position.

7. **Repeat on the Other Side:**
   - Now, repeat the stretch with your left arm by bringing it across your body and using your right hand to hold it. Again, hold for 15 to 30 seconds.

8. **Complete the Stretch:**
   - After completing both sides, take a moment to notice any changes in how your shoulders feel and relax before moving onto another activity.

#### Precautions:

- **Listen to Your Body:** Ensure that you only stretch to the point of mild discomfort. If you feel any sharp pain or strain, ease out of the stretch immediately.

- **Avoid Overstretching:** Never force your arm into the stretch; go into the stretch gradually and allow your muscles to adapt.

- **Consider Your Condition:** If you have any pre-existing shoulder injuries or conditions (like rotator cuff issues), consult with a healthcare professional or physical therapist before performing this stretch.

- **Maintain Proper Posture:** Ensure your back remains straight throughout the stretch; slouching can negate the benefits and may lead to injury.

- **Warm-Up First:** It's advisable to perform a brief warm-up before stretching, such as light arm circles or shoulder shrugs, to prepare the muscles.

By incorporating the Seated Shoulder Stretch into your routine, you'll help maintain shoulder health and flexibility in a simple and effective manner. Happy stretching!
