#### Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. **Starting Position:**
   - Begin in a tabletop position on your yoga mat with your hands under your shoulders and knees under your hips.

2. **Leg Positioning:**
   - Bring your right knee forward and place it behind your right wrist, while your right ankle should be positioned in front of your left hip. The right foot should be flexed.
   - Extend your left leg straight back behind you, keeping your hips squared.

3. **Lowering Into the Pose:**
   - As you exhale, gently lower your hips toward the floor. If your hips are very high off the ground, you can place a folded blanket or cushion under your right hip for support.

4. **Finding Length:**
   - Keep your torso upright at first. Press your hands firmly on the mat on either side of your hips. Ensure that your shoulders settle away from your ears.

5. **Melting Down:**
   - If you feel stable, start to walk your hands forward and lower your torso down towards the floor, coming onto your forearms or resting your forehead on the mat.

6. **Hold the Pose:**
   - Keep your breath steady and deep. Hold this position for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or for as long as comfortable while maintaining proper alignment.

7. **Releasing the Stretch:**
   - To come out of the pose, press into your hands, lifting your torso back up. Tuck your left toes under and bring your left knee forward to return to the table position.

8. **Switch Sides:**
   - Repeat steps 2 to 7 on the left side to ensure balanced stretching of both hamstrings.
