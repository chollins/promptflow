## Area: Arms
### Muscle: Triceps Brachii

## Stretch: Overhead Triceps Stretch

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Find a Comfortable Position**: Start by standing or sitting in a comfortable position. Ensure your spine is straight and your shoulders are relaxed.

2. **Raise One Arm**: Lift your right arm overhead, keeping it straight.

3. **Bend the Elbow**: Bend the elbow of your raised arm, bringing your hand down the center of your back. Your palm should be touching your upper back or shoulder blade.

4. **Support the Elbow**: With your left hand, gently grasp the elbow of your right arm, applying light pressure. Ensure that your left arm stays at shoulder level to avoid straining your shoulder.

5. **Hold the Stretch**: Maintain this position, feeling the stretch in your triceps. Ensure that your head remains aligned with your spine and does not jut forward.

6. **Breathe Deeply**: While holding this position, take deep breaths in and out. Aim to hold the stretch for 15-30 seconds.

7. **Release the Stretch**: Slowly release your grip and allow your right arm to return to the starting position.

8. **Repeat on the Other Side**: Perform the same steps for your left arm to ensure that both sides are equally stretched.

### Benefits:

- **Increases Flexibility**: The overhead triceps stretch improves flexibility in the triceps brachii, enhancing your range of motion in the arms.
- **Relieves Muscle Tension**: This stretch helps to alleviate tension and discomfort in the upper arms, especially after activities such as weightlifting or overhead movements.

### Precautions:

- **Warm Up First**: Perform a brief warm-up to prepare your muscles before stretching. This can include light aerobic activity or dynamic stretches.
- **Consult a Professional**: If you have any prior injuries or medical conditions affecting your arms or shoulders, consult a healthcare provider or a physical therapist before attempting this stretch.
- **Balance**: Ensure you perform this stretch equally on both sides to maintain balance and avoid muscle imbalances.
