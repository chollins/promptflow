- **Increases Flexibility:** Enhances the flexibility of the brachialis muscle and surrounding arm structures, leading to improved range of motion.
- **Reduces Muscle Tension:** Helps alleviate tightness and tension in the arms and shoulders, fostering relaxation.
- **Enhances Circulation:** Promotes blood flow to the upper extremities, which can aid in muscle recovery and overall arm function.

### Precautions

- **Warm-Up First:** Always warm up with light aerobic activity before stretching, particularly if you're engaging in other physical activities afterward.
- **Listen to Your Body:** Do not force the stretch. If you feel pain (not to be confused with mild discomfort), ease off the stretch.
- **Avoid Twisting:** Make sure to keep your torso aligned, as twisting can lead to strain in the back or shoulders.
- **Pre-existing Conditions:** If you have any shoulder injuries or conditions, consult with a healthcare professional or a physical therapist before attempting this stretch.
- **Do Not Bounce:** Hold the stretch in a steady position; avoid bouncing or jerky movements to prevent muscle strain.
