## Precautions

- **Warm Up First:** Always perform a light warm-up for 5-10 minutes before stretching to avoid injury. This can include dynamic movements or light aerobic activities.

- **Consult a Professional:** If you have any pre-existing conditions, injuries, or concerns regarding your ability to perform this stretch, consult with a healthcare professional or a certified trainer before proceeding.

- **Listen to Your Body:** If you experience any sharp pain or discomfort, ease out of the stretch and rest. Modify the stretch if needed to suit your comfort level.
