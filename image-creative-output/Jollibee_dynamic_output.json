    "image_prompts": "1. \"A large, rustic wooden table set in the middle of a lush, sunlit garden. The table is laden with a feast of colorful, fresh foods - fruits, vegetables, breads, and a large, roasted turkey in the center. A diverse group of people, young and old, are seated around the table, laughing, talking, and sharing food. The style should be realistic and detailed, with warm, natural lighting highlighting the vibrant colors of the food and the joy on the people's faces. The composition should be from a slightly elevated angle, capturing the entire scene of communal dining.\"\n\n2. \"An elegant banquet hall illuminated by soft, warm chandeliers. Long tables are adorned with white tablecloths, crystal glassware, and an array of delicious gourmet dishes. A crowd of well-dressed people are gathered, some are seated enjoying their meals, others are standing and engaging in lively conversations. The style should be realistic with a touch of impressionism, focusing on the grandeur of the event and the sense of community. The composition should be from a guest's perspective, capturing the opulence of the event and the shared enjoyment of the feast.\"\n\n3. \"A family kitchen bathed in the soft, warm glow of the setting sun filtering through a window. A mother and her children are preparing a meal together - chopping vegetables, stirring a pot, setting the table. Their faces are lit up with smiles, showing the joy and connection they share. The style should be realistic, with a focus on the intimate, everyday moments that turn meals into memories. The composition should be from a side angle, capturing the family in action and the love and support they share through their shared task.\""
