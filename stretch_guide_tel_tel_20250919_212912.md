## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Stand Up Straight**  
   Begin by standing tall with your feet shoulder-width apart. Ensure your body is aligned and your posture is correct, with shoulders back and relaxed.

2. **Extend Your Arms**  
   Take a deep breath in. Raise your arms to shoulder height, keeping them parallel to the ground.

3. **Palms Up**  
   Rotate your palms to face upwards (supinated position). 

4. **Push Back**  
   Slowly straighten your arms and push your fingers back behind you as if you are trying to spread your fingers wide. 

5. **Gaze Up**  
   While pushing your arms back, gently tilt your head back and gaze upwards. This helps to open up the entire front body.

6. **Hold the Position**  
   Maintain this position for **15-30 seconds**, breathing slowly and deeply. Focus on feeling the stretch in your biceps and brachialis.

7. **Release**  
   Gradually relax your arms back to your sides and return to a neutral standing position.
